Let me judge your mails, tool to survey mailing lists health.

When you own a mailing lists server you may want to time how long the messages need to reach some providers, this enable you to detect any problem on a server or on a specific provider. This simple tool should fulfill this requirement.

It is writtent in ruby and require some basic ruby knowledge to install and customize it.

The code is pretty simple and should be easy to hack on, contact me if you have any question.

# How it works:
Create a specific mailing list and an account for each mail providers you want to watch and subscribe them to the list. One background task should be setupped to launch mails to the mailing list, and another task will connect to the accounts and fetch the resulting messages. The result are displayed on a webapp and late mails generates twitter messages for the server admin.

# Installation

- checkout the code
- install the bundler gem
- in the checkout directory run `bundle install`
- (optional) change the database url in the `config.ru` file, by default a `dredd.sqlite3` sqlite database will be used
- in the checkout directory, run `rackup`
- open your browser on <http://localhost:9292>

# Configuration

- Connect to the database and add some user using their OpenId identifiers `insert into users(openid_identifier) values('http://XXXXXX.myopenid.com/');`
- Connect to  <http://localhost:9292/config> for the mail configuration and pick a backend password for the backfround tasks (see later)
- Connect to  <http://localhost:9292/admin> and add some accounts
- cron a http request to <http://localhost:9292/backend_send_mail/XXX> (where `XXX` is the backend password) to send the mails
- cron a http request to <http://localhost:9292/backend_check_mail/XXX> (where `XXX` is the backend password) to fecth the mails
